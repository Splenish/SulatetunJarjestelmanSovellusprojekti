# SulatetunJarjestelmanSovellusprojekti

Vehicle Tracker

Our project is about creating a solution that used Nucleo MBED and Raspberry Bi in union with some nonlinear sensors.
We decided on creating a website where a client from company can track their companys physical assets eg. cars in a livemap and also see their statuses listed.

Premise

We are using NodeJS to create an HTTP server and host our website there. We use MySQL to store information in a database about the units that track the GPS and sensor data.
